2026-01-19,Lululemon Robson Street Vancouver,5,"Most of my wardrobe is Lulu because they have clothing and apparel for any occasion. For me, comfort & convenience is priority, whether working out or going out for the evening. I haven't purchased a pair of jeans, ""slacks"", dress shirts, or even blazers by any other brands in well over a decade because I know I can rely on high quality merch that's easy to wear & will last long. With such a selection, I've continued to refresh my look with ABC pants, seasonal tops, and workout gear, knowing I'll have the same comfort & fits. With plenty of styles, colors, and materials to choose from, it's easy to keep my style fresh every time I add a new piece.
The Robson location is the only store I ever shop in the flesh because I can just as easily follow the ""We Made Too Much"" category online for sales on different colors & materials of what I know will fit already, plus lots of bonus Aeroplan points!
At this location, it really seems like each staff member enjoy their jobs. I don't think they could fake their consistently exceptional customer service! The occasions I go in alone, the staff are always flying around helping with sizes, etc... So what I appreciate the most in this store are the honest opinions from whoever is helping me in the fitting room area. If it doesn't look right, they will come up with another option, but when they give me a green light, I can feel confident with my purchases. Their return/exchange policies for members are the easiest I've experienced. Their turn around time with alterations is never more than five days, & often less. It's an uplifting, above & beyond experience, from their greeters to the till👌😊",POSITIVE,0.9938627481460571
2026-01-19,Lululemon Robson Street Vancouver,5,"Today, my wanderings took me to a place I don't usually go .
Lululemon.
Yeah, I know.
Me, a guy who's practically colorblind and has zero patience for shopping, stepping into the world of athletic wear. My mission? A few shirts.
My usual experience in these places? A test of endurance.
My eyes glazing over different shades of light green and light blue.
ready to just find a quiet corner somewhere. And that’s when Natalie ask me if I need any help .
I think she saw the quiet frustration in my eyes .
The unspoken plea of a man who just wanted to buy some damn shirts and get out.
She moved with the precision of a seasoned guide, pulling options, getting the colors right and done .
before I could even fully register what was happening.
In and out.
A surgical strike. Natalie, you're a godsend.
You made what I expected to be a chore into a surprisingly pleasant experience.
So, if you find yourself at Lululemon, and you're not entirely sure where to begin, seek out Natali.
I will return that’s for sure.",NEGATIVE,0.9933915138244629
2026-01-19,Lululemon Robson Street Vancouver,1,"Yesterday, I made a large purchase at the flagship store. The cashier, an Asian female employee with glasses and medium-length hair, showed a very impatient attitude throughout the checkout process. After completing the payment, she did not fold the clothes and simply handed me the receipt without any care.

This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at Lululemon.",NEGATIVE,0.9996641874313354
2026-01-19,Lululemon Robson Street Vancouver,5,"Lulu Lemon 🍋 is a a really good active brand for women in the athletic department and just every day general wear. Although I must say that I defend Chip Wilson Collections because he is the owner and the maker of this company but also stuff being sold should go his way as he is the rightful person of Ownership. His collections were truly the best and also the most comfortable in Canada. I believe his products should be back on the shelves because from a female perspective his products were attractive, appealing and comfortable for woman who can actively move everyday.",POSITIVE,0.9991961121559143

2026-01-19,Lululemon Georgia Street Pacific Centre Vancouver,5,"Exceptional service - Franklin and Gracia.

Went above and beyond, grabbed items from the mannequin for me. Helped me pick out the T-shirt as well (they all look the same to me lmao, but the fabrics are different which is important when selecting for your needs - thank you for the assistance).

Ended up purchasing 7"" shorts from Alo and 5"" shorts from Lululemon. Lululemon culture/and QC was significantly better. After checking the items at home, quality and consistency was SIGNIFICANTLY better at Lululemon.

I had wanted to check Alo (currently privately held company, could potentially look to go public to scale IMO), to see if the rumors regarding their effort and respect were justified. I was shocked. You have to do due diligence when shopping at Alo, (or just purchase from Lululemon IMO). I had asked for a specific color that they ""had in the back"", I came home and noticed a pin through the fabric, and the Alo tag marked up - which I should have checked). Unacceptable, especially for shorts over $100.

Lululemon was impressive. Not the same experience at Alo. First time there, no relation to the companies. Not a Lululemon shareholder (although I might consider it now lmao), or ever was.",POSITIVE,0.9849612712860107
2026-01-19,Lululemon Georgia Street Pacific Centre Vancouver,1,"Absolutely ridiculous experience at Lululemon. One pant leg is a full 2 inches longer than the other!

I reached out for support after just a few weeks of owning them, and here’s the response they hit me with:

“Based on the photos provided, your product is not showing any signs of any quality issues or defects…”

Excuse me? Two pant legs not matching is apparently normal now?

Safe to say I won’t be shopping here again.

Future shoppers: bring a measuring tape with you unless you want to DIY tailor your overpriced athleisure.",NEGATIVE,0.9987484216690063

2026-01-19,Lululemon Kitsilano Vancouver,2,"They claim this is the first Lululemon store opened by Chip Wilson, but honestly, it doesn’t feel like it. If it’s truly such an important and historic location for the brand, you would expect it to be designed and presented in a way that reflects that significance — something unique or memorable.

The store layout is also a bit strange. There are two completely separate sections for men and women, connected only by a narrow corridor. The men’s section is noticeably smaller and feels like an afterthought, with very limited product selection and almost no variety.

Overall, I didn’t enjoy visiting this branch. If you’re looking for a wide range of items or a more special experience, this location might not be worth the trip.",NEGATIVE,0.9905896186828613
2026-01-19,Lululemon Kitsilano Vancouver,1,"It seems that the return and exchange policies differ between the Robson store and the Kitsilano store.

I came here a few weeks after purchasing 13 items to return two of them. They kept insisting that a refund was not possible, and that even store credit on a gift card could not be given. It honestly felt like no one really understood the return policy, and the explanation I was given was unclear and inconsistent.

They told me that only a size exchange was possible. While checking the item, I noticed hair and dust on it, so I asked the staff member standing there (wearing glasses with braided hair) if there was another new item available. She looked at me like I was being unreasonable and repeatedly said that it was a new item. I already know it was supposed to be new, but seeing hair and dust on it made me uncomfortable.

While she went to the back, I could see other staff members looking at me, and it felt very unpleasant and unprofessional. The whole interaction made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected.

After that, I went to the Robson store, where I was able to exchange my size, receive product recommendations, and get my refund as store credit on a gift card without any issues.

I will not be returning to this location.",NEGATIVE,0.9969879984855652

I can't remember all the name except for Cora (spelling?) who was Irish and telling me about the Dublin Marathon! Great chat with all the employees and made a fantastic experience!

The staff is always ready to help, providing ideas, insights, sizes, colours and styles for your needs, and make everyone feel welcomed. Team members Parker and Clara have always made my visits unique, with their masterful customer service, kindness, care and attention to detail. Even at the sake of convenience, I will wait and do my shopping at the West 4th location.

2026-01-19,Lululemon Burnaby Brentwood,1,"I usually enjoy shopping at Lululemon, but this experience was very upsetting.

My boyfriend was trying on clothes in the fitting room, and I briefly stepped inside only to hand him a jacket and help decide what he should try on first. There was nothing inappropriate happening.

Without any warning or verbal notice, an employee suddenly pulled the fitting room curtain fully open and told us that two people were not allowed inside. This was extremely embarrassing and felt like a complete violation of privacy.

If there is a policy, it should be communicated verbally and respectfully first, not by forcefully opening a curtain while customers are inside. The employee appeared to be the oldest staff member in the store, which made the lack of professionalism even more disappointing.

I hope Lululemon provides better training on customer privacy and respectful communication. This experience has negatively affected my impression of the brand.",NEGATIVE,0.9970322847366333

Instead of apologizing, the staff member simply asked for my name and said nothing else. There was no acknowledgment of the mistake or how inappropriate the situation was.
When I came out of the fitting room, the same staff member avoided eye contact and continued chatting with others, as if nothing had happened.

He said again it’s the same thing you gave these 3 items with this card you go and get the colour you want. Then when it was all over I went to look at the prices of the items they were on sale, so I lost the value of my stuff if I knew they were on sale items would keep my stuff.
