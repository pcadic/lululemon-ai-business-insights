Lululemon AI Business Insights
















📌 Project Overview

Lululemon AI Business Insights is an end-to-end data analytics & AI project designed to transform real customer feedback into executive-level insights.

The project automatically:

Collects real Google Maps reviews from Lululemon stores in Vancouver

Applies state-of-the-art NLP models via Hugging Face

Produces business KPIs, store performance scores, and actionable insights

Publishes results in an interactive dashboard for decision-makers

🎯 This is not a Kaggle or toy project — all data is real, current, and collected via public APIs.

🧩 Business Questions Answered

This project answers questions a Retail Director or Operations Manager would ask:

Which stores underperform vs the network?

What are the main customer pain points (staff, service, returns, pricing…)?

Which issues are actionable vs noise?

How does each store score overall (0–100)?

Where should leadership focus operational improvements?
